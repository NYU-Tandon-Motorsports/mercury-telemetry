## Contributor Workflow
1. Make a feature branch `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`. Then, make your changes
2. Ensure that you include tests that exercise not only your feature, but also any other code that might be impacted. This is very important.
3. Check you are using consistent style by running `scripts/check.sh` and make any recommended changes (such as running black to re-format). Then run your tests with `python manage.py test` and fix errors. 
4. Add files you changed using `git add -A`. Then commit your changes with `git commit -m "<what_this_commit_does>"`.
5. Push your branch to the origin fork with `git push origin <new_branch_name>` of the branch you made locally.
